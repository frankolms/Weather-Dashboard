# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that takes a city from the user as an input and displays the current weather and the five day forecast of that city on the page. This app saves all of your searches and appends buttons below the search bar based on those searches. These buttons will allow you to generate the weather and five day forecast instead of typing in the city every time you want to get the weather at that location.
